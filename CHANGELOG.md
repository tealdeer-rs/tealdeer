### [v1.8.0][v1.8.0] (2025-10-03)

One year and one day have passed since tealdeer version 1.7.0 was released, so
it's time for an update! Tealdeer 1.8 comes with a complete rewrite of the page
cache and contains many long awaited improvements around it.

Firstly, tealdeer now supports language-specific downloads. This means that only
the pages matching the configured languages are downloaded when updating the
cache. The languages used for searching pages can be configured separately to
the ones used for updating, so it is possible to download pages in languages
that are not usually queried.

Next to configuring which languages are used for searching, it is now also
possible to specify which platforms are used in the config file. Importantly,
the default behavior for page search has changed so that all platforms are
searched if no page is found for the platform that tealdeer is running on. To
restore the behavior of tealdeer 1.7, users should set
```toml
[search]
platforms = ["current", "common"]
```
in their config file.

Coming back to updating, the default build configuration of tealdeer now
includes multiple TLS backends. This means that tealdeer does not have to be
rebuilt to try out a different TLS backend. The used backend can be chosen in
the config file. By default, tealdeer comes with support for rustls using webpki
certificates or system certificates. Native TLS is supported, but not enabled by
default to avoid build troubles with OpenSSL and musl.

For details, please refer to the [user documentation].

#### Notes to package maintainers

1. The MSRV has been bumped to 1.85.
2. Consider whether you want to include the `native-tls` feature in your build
   of tealdeer. The feature is disabled for the binaries in the GitHub release
   because we target musl, but it might work out of the box for your
   distribution.
3. We have added the `ignore-online-tests` feature to automatically mark all
   tests that require an internet connection as skipped, so you can use this
   feature instead of maintaining a list of these tests yourself.

### [v1.7.2][v1.7.2] (2025-03-18)

This patch release updates the `zip` dependency to mitigate a potential security
vulnerability. A successful attack against tealdeer users would require
manipulation of the tldr pages archive downloaded during an update. As the
archive is downloaded from a trusted source (the tldr-pages organization), it
seems very unlikely that running a version of tealdeer prior to 1.7.2 poses a
security risk. Nevertheless, it cannot hurt to rule out any chance of an attack
by updating tealdeer to version 1.7.2.

For more details, please see https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-94vh-gphv-8pm8.

- [security] Require `zip >= 2.3.0`
- [chore] Run CI on backport branches and on dispatch

### [v1.7.1][v1.7.1] (2024-11-14)

This patch release updates the `yansi` dependency to version 1, so that the
previous versions of `yansi` can be removed from the package sets of Linux
distributions. This change should not impact the behavior of tealdeer.

#### Changes:

- [chore] Upgrade yansi: 0.5.1 -> 1.0.1 ([#389])

#### Contributors to this version:

- [Blair Noctis][@nc7s]

Thanks!

### [v1.7.0][v1.7.0] (2024-10-02)

It's been 24 months since the last release, time for tealdeer 1.7.0! Thanks to
16 individual contributors, a few nice changes and features are included in
this release.

One change is that you can **query multiple platforms at once**. For example:

    tldr --platform openbsd --platform linux df

This will show the `df` page for OpenBSD (if available), followed by Linux (if
available), with fallback to the current platform on which tealdeer runs.

What's that `openbsd` thing up there? Yes, there's now **support for the BSD
platforms `freebsd`, `netbsd` and `openbsd`**.

And since we're already talking about platform support: Our **binary releases
now include builds for ARM64 (aka `aarch64`) on macOS (Apple Silicon, M1/M2/M3)
and Linux**. _(Keep in mind that binary releases are generated in CI and are
unsigned. For a trusted build, please compile from source.)_

There's also a breaking change for the folks using [custom pages and
patches](https://tealdeer-rs.github.io/tealdeer/usage_custom_pages.html): These
files now use a `.md` extension. Old files will continue to work, but will
result a deprecation warning being printed when used.

On a personal note, this will be the last release from me
([Danilo](https://github.com/dbrgn/)) as primary maintainer of tealdeer. For
details, see [#376](https://github.com/tealdeer-rs/tealdeer/issues/376).

### [v1.6.0][v1.6.0] (2022-10-02)

It's been 9 months since the last release already! This is not a huge update
feature-wise, but it still contains a few nice new improvements and a few
bugfixes, contributed by 11 different people. The most important new feature is
probably the option to override the cache directory through the config file.
The `TEALDEER_CACHE_DIR` env variable is now deprecated.

A note to packagers: Shell completions have been moved to the `completion/`
subdirectory! Packaging scripts might need to be updated.

#### Changes:

- [added] Allow overriding cache directory through config ([#276])
- [added] Add `--no-auto-update` CLI flag ([#257])
- [added] Show note about auto-updates when cache is missing ([#254])

- [fixed] Do not page output of `tldr --update` ([#231])
- [fixed] Create macOS release builds with bundled root certificates ([#272])
- [fixed] Clean up and fix shell completions ([#262])
- [deprecated] The `TEALDEER_CACHE_DIR` env variable is now deprecated ([#276])
- [removed] The `--config-path` command was removed, use `--show-paths` instead ([#290])
- [removed] The `-o/--os` command was removed, use `-p/--platform` instead ([#290])
- [removed] The `-m/--markdown` command was removed, use `-r/--raw` instead ([#290])
- [chore] Move shell completion scripts to their own directory ([#259])

### [v1.5.0][v1.5.0] (2021-12-31)

This is quite a big release with many new features. In the 15 months since the
last release, 59 pull requests from 16 different contributors were merged!

The highlights:

- **Custom pages and patches**: You can now create your own local-only tldr
  pages. But not just that, you can also extend existing upstream pages with
  your own examples. For more details, see
  [the docs](https://tealdeer-rs.github.io/tealdeer/usage_custom_pages.html).
- **Change argument parsing from docopt to clap**: We replaced docopt.rs as
  argument parsing library with clap v3, resulting in almost 1 MiB smaller
  binaries and a 22% speed increase when rendering a tldr page.
- **Multi-language support**: You can now override the language with `-L/--language`.
- **A new `--show-paths` command**: By running `tldr --show-paths`, you can list
  the currently used config dir, cache dir, upstream pages dir and custom pages dir.
- **Compliance with the tldr client spec v1.5**: We renamed `-o/--os` to
  `-p/--platform` and implemented transparent lowercasing of the page names.
- **Docs**: The README based documentation has reached its limits. There are
  now new mdbook based docs over at
  [tealdeer-rs.github.io/tealdeer/](https://tealdeer-rs.github.io/tealdeer/), we hope these
  make using tealdeer easier. Of course, documentation improvements are
  welcome! Also, if you're confused about how to use a certain feature, feel
  free to open an issue, this way we can improve the docs.

[changed][i190]:
